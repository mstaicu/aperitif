# Development

1. Add a script in the Makefile to create certificates for the Ingress resource
2. For the local LoadBalancer, use the TLS certificate in Traefik
    tls:
      secretName: example-local-tls

# Production

1. For the production LoadBalancer, use the TLS certificate provided by DigitalOcean
2. If you manage your domain with DigitalOcean DNS, you can choose the Letâ€™s Encrypt option to create a new, fully-managed SSL certificate. We create and automatically renew this certificate for you. https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/networking/load-balancers/how-to/ssl-termination/

# Both

1. Don't redirect to HTTPS, remove the access token if a request is done over HTTP
