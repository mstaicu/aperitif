   *
   * If a request with a `Content-Type: application/json` header is
   * made to a route, this middleware will treat the request body as
   * a JSON string. It will attempt to parse it with `JSON.parse()`
   * and set the resulting object (or array) on a `body` property of
   * the request object, which you can access in your route handlers,
   * or other general middleware.
